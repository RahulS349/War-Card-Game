# War-Card-Game

Welcome to the War Card Game, a classic card game implemented in Python!

This project recreates the popular card game War, where players battle it out using standard decks of cards. The game involves drawing cards and comparing their values. The player with the higher card wins the round and collects both cards. If the cards have the same value, a "war" is declared, and each player draws additional cards until a winner is determined.

Key Features:

Player vs. Computer: The game will feature a single-player mode where you'll face off against a computer opponent.
Card Dealing: The game will simulate the dealing of cards from a standard deck.
Card Comparison: The values of the drawn cards will be compared to determine the winner of each round.
War Resolution: When cards have the same value, a "war" will be triggered, requiring players to draw additional cards until a winner is decided.
Game Over: The game will end when one player has collected all 52 cards.
By playing this Python implementation of War, you can enjoy a classic card game experience from the comfort of your own computer. Feel free to explore the code and customize it to your liking!
